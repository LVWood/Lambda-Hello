Hi Lambda! I'm Leslee Wood. 
I'm creative, thoughtful, and usually quiet. 
There are a lot of things I love to do and they're mostly in the arts.
I'm a musicican first and foremost: I compose, sing, and study music history. My graduate degrees are in musicology (basically music history and theory) and music composition.
I also love art (printmaking is my thing) and design and my undergrad minor was theatre.
I would say I don't have a favorite animal, but I'm filling my house with plants instead.
